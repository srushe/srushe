### Hello ðŸ‘‹, nice to see you!

Given GitHub's [ongoing policy of collaborating with ICE](https://thenextweb.com/politics/2019/10/09/github-microsoft-trump-ice-contract/) I don't feel comfortable supporting the platform ([as](https://deeden.co.uk/notes/2019/10/24/085956/) [I've](https://deeden.co.uk/notes/2019/11/15/094544/) [mentioned](https://deeden.co.uk/notes/2019/11/20/160118/) [elsewhere](https://deeden.co.uk/notes/2020/04/14/165427/)), so I've gradually moved all of my repositories (both private and public) to [SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~srushe/).

I've hoped that GitHub would cancel their policy ([as do many of the staff](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/letter-from-github-employees-to-ceo-about-the-company-s-ice-contract/fb280de9-2bc3-40d5-b1a5-e3b954bf0d25/), including good people I know), but nothing has happened, so as GitHub won't drop ICE I've dropped GitHub for my personal accounts.
